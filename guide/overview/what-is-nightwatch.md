Nightwatch.js is an integrated framework for performing automated end-to-end testing on web applications and websites, across all major browsers. It is written in [Node.js][1] and uses the [W3C WebDriver API][2] to interact with various browsers.</p>

<p>It is a complete solution for end-to-end and cross-browser testing. It aims to simplify the process of writing and running various types of tests, including:</p>

<ul class="introduction">
    <li>end-to-end tests on all major web browsers</li>
    <li>unit tests of Node.js services</li>
    <li>integration tests of HTTP APIs</li>
</ul>

<p class="secondary-text">Nightwatch was created in 2014 in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, and the name was inspired by the famous painting [The Night Watch](https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/collection/SK-C-5) by Dutch 17th century artist [Rembrandt van Rijn](https://www.rembrandthuis.nl/en/meet-rembrandt/). The masterpiece is prominently displayed in the Rijksmuseum, in Amsterdam. Read more about how Nightwatch was created [here][4].</p>

### Architecture overview

Nightwatch is distributed as an easy to use CLI tool and has built-in support for all major browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.  

Nightwatch performs the browser automation by taking advantage of the industry standard protocol **WebDriver**, which is defined as a W3C standard specification.

## What is WebDriver?

<p class="whatis-logo w3c-logo"><img src="https://www.w3.org/StyleSheets/TR/2016/logos/W3C" alt="W3C WebDriver" title="W3C WebDriver" class="whatis"></p>

<p>[WebDriver][7] is a general purpose library for automating web browsers, part of the [Selenium][5] project. It is now a [W3C specification][10] which standardises browser automation, providing a reliable and consistent protocol to remotely control web browsers via a restful **HTTP API**.</p>

<p>Created more than a decade ago, **Selenium** is by far the most widely used project in the automated testing industry, providing a comprehensive set of tools for browser automation, initially written for Java but now with support for most programming languages.</p>

Internally, Nightwatch uses the [W3C WebDriver API][6] to perform the browser automation related tasks, such as opening windows or clicking links.

### Support for Selenium Grid and Cloud Providers

Nightwatch can also be used for distributed cross-browser end-to-end testing at scale together with the [Selenium Server][13] (also known as **Selenium Grid**), which is an open-source project written in Java that manages a network of WebDriver nodes.

Nightwatch also can be integrated with cloud-based testing platforms like [Browserstack][14], [SauceLabs][15], [CrossBrowserTesting][16], or [LambdaTest][17].

### Supported browsers

WebDriver is implemented by all major browser vendors as a W3C compliant HTTP service.
